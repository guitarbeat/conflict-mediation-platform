# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Co-op Conflict Resolution Platform currently has layout issues on smaller screens, specifically with excessive right-side padding that causes content to be cut off or poorly positioned. This feature will fix the responsive design to ensure the application works properly across all device sizes, particularly on mobile devices and tablets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the platform on a mobile device, I want the layout to properly fit my screen without excessive padding or cut-off content, so that I can effectively use all features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform on a screen width less than 768px THEN the system SHALL remove excessive right-side padding
2. WHEN content is displayed on mobile screens THEN the system SHALL ensure all text and interactive elements are fully visible
3. WHEN the viewport width changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust padding and margins to maintain proper content visibility
4. WHEN users interact with step navigation on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure all step indicators are accessible and properly spaced

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on a tablet device, I want the platform to utilize the available screen space efficiently, so that I don't have to scroll unnecessarily or deal with awkward spacing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform on a tablet (768px to 1024px width) THEN the system SHALL optimize padding for medium-sized screens
2. WHEN content sections are displayed on tablets THEN the system SHALL maintain readability while maximizing space utilization
3. WHEN the orientation changes on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the platform, I want consistent responsive design patterns, so that future updates maintain proper mobile compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing responsive styles THEN the system SHALL use consistent breakpoint values across all components
2. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL follow established mobile-first responsive design patterns
3. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL work correctly across all major mobile browsers
4. WHEN viewport dimensions change THEN the system SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and usability
