# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the emoji dragging interaction in the EmojiGridMapper component to provide a smooth, responsive, and natural dragging experience. Currently, users experience lag or delay when dragging the emoji, which creates a poor user experience and makes the emotional positioning feel imprecise.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out the conflict resolution form, I want the emoji to follow my mouse cursor smoothly and immediately when dragging, so that I can precisely position it to reflect my emotional state without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click and drag the emoji THEN it SHALL move immediately with my mouse cursor without perceptible delay
2. WHEN I move my mouse during dragging THEN the emoji SHALL maintain its position relative to my cursor consistently
3. WHEN I drag the emoji quickly THEN it SHALL keep up with my mouse movement without lag or stuttering
4. WHEN I drag the emoji slowly THEN it SHALL move smoothly without jittery or choppy motion
5. IF I drag outside the circular boundary THEN the emoji SHALL smoothly constrain to the circle edge while maintaining cursor tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on a touch device, I want the emoji dragging to work smoothly with touch gestures, so that I can use the emotional positioning feature effectively on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I touch and drag the emoji on a mobile device THEN it SHALL follow my finger smoothly
2. WHEN I drag with touch THEN the page SHALL NOT scroll or interfere with the dragging motion
3. WHEN I lift my finger THEN the emoji SHALL remain in the final position without jumping or shifting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the emotion chart, I want the dragging performance to be consistent regardless of device capabilities, so that the experience feels professional and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging occurs THEN the frame rate SHALL remain smooth (targeting 60fps)
2. WHEN multiple UI updates happen simultaneously THEN the emoji dragging SHALL maintain priority and smoothness
3. WHEN the browser is under load THEN the dragging experience SHALL degrade gracefully without becoming unusable
4. IF the device has limited processing power THEN the dragging SHALL still feel responsive through optimized rendering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this component, I want the dragging implementation to be performant and well-optimized, so that it doesn't negatively impact the overall application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dragging occurs THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be minimized through proper React optimization
2. WHEN mouse/touch events fire THEN only essential calculations SHALL be performed in the event handlers
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN all event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN dragging is not active THEN no performance overhead SHALL be incurred from the dragging system
