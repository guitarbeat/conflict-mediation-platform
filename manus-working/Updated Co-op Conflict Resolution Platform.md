## Major Improvements

### 1. Draggable Valence-Arousal Circumplex Chart
The most significant enhancement is the replacement of simple emotion word badges with an interactive emotion mapping system:

#### Features:
- **Interactive Dragging:** Users can drag an emoji around a circular chart to express their emotional state
- **Valence & Arousal Mapping:** The chart maps emotions across two dimensions:
  - **Valence (X-axis):** Pleasant to unpleasant emotions (-1 to +1)
  - **Arousal (Y-axis):** Low to high energy emotions (-1 to +1)
- **Dynamic Visual Feedback:** 
  - Background color changes based on position
  - Emoji size increases with distance from center
  - Quadrant labels appear during dragging
- **Emotion Categories:**
  - **Top-Right:** Happy/Excited emotions (😄, 🤩, 😆, 🥳, 😁)
  - **Top-Left:** Angry/Frustrated emotions (😤, 😠, 🤬, 😡, 😣)
  - **Bottom-Left:** Sad/Depressed emotions (😢, 😞, 😔, 😿, 😭)
  - **Bottom-Right:** Calm/Peaceful emotions (😌, 😊, 🙂, 😇, ☺️)
  - **Center:** Neutral emotions (😐, 🤔, 😶)

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Responsive Design:** Chart adapts to different screen sizes
- **Touch Support:** Works on mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations:** Elastic snap-back to center
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live emotion label and intensity display
- **Data Capture:** Records emoji, label, valence, and arousal values

### 2. Enhanced User Guidance
Clear instructions now appear on every page to eliminate confusion about who should be working on each section:

#### Step-by-Step Guidance:
- **Setup:** "Both parties, please fill out this section together."
- **Individual Reflection A:** "Party A, please complete this section individually. Party B should not look at these responses yet."
- **Individual Reflection B:** "Party B, please complete this section individually. Party A should not look at these responses yet."
- **Shared Discussion:** "Both parties, please discuss and fill out this section together."
- **Solution Development:** "Both parties, please work together to develop solutions."
- **Agreement & Action Steps:** "Both parties, finalize your agreement and action steps."

### 3. Updated Visual Design
The website now uses the specified color palette throughout:

#### Color Scheme:
- **Primary Green (#59981A):** Main buttons, accents, progress bars
- **Dark Green (#3D550C):** Text, headers, darker elements
- **Light Green (#81B622):** Secondary accents, highlights, borders
- **Cream/Yellow (#ECF87F):** Background, softer elements

#### Design Elements:
- **Integrated Logo:** Co-op logo prominently displayed in header
- **Consistent Typography:** Clear hierarchy with green color scheme
- **Professional Layout:** Clean cards with proper spacing
- **Visual Progress Indicators:** Enhanced progress bar and step indicators

### 4. Improved User Experience
Several UX enhancements make the platform more intuitive:

#### Navigation:
- **Clear Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar shows completion percentage
- **Step Indicators:** Dot navigation shows current position
- **Contextual Alerts:** Information boxes explain each section's purpose

#### Form Improvements:
- **Better Field Organization:** Logical grouping of related inputs
- **Responsive Layout:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded communication approaches (aggressive=red, passive=yellow, assertive=green)

## Technical Features

### Emotion Chart Integration
- **State Management:** Selected emotions are preserved throughout the session
- **Cross-Reference:** Emotions from individual reflection appear in shared discussion
- **Export Capability:** Emotion data included in final session summary

### Enhanced Data Structure
The platform now captures more detailed emotional data:
```json
{
  "selectedEmotion": {
    "emoji": "😤",
    "label": "Frustrated",
    "valence": -0.6,
    "arousal": 0.8,
    "position": { "x": -0.6, "y": 0.8 }
  }
}
```

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile Optimization:** Touch-friendly emotion chart
- **Flexible Layouts:** Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation support

## Based on Source Material Analysis

### Faithful Implementation
The updated platform maintains strict adherence to the ICC Austin mediation framework:

#### Individual Reflection (Intrapersonal):
- **"I think..."** - Beliefs about the conflict
- **"I feel..."** - Now enhanced with emotion chart
- **"I want..."** - Three communication approaches with clear guidance
- **"Why/Because..."** - Synthesis section

#### Shared Discussion (ABCDE Model):
- **A - Activating Event:** Collaborative agreement on initial cause
- **B - Beliefs:** Each party's perspective with listening confirmation
- **C - Consequences:** Emotional impacts (referencing chart selections)
- **D - Disputations:** Understanding motivations and misunderstandings
- **E - Effects:** Reflections and insights gained

#### Solution Development:
- **Miracle Question:** Visualization exercise
- **Top 3 Solutions:** Individual brainstorming
- **Perspective Taking:** Understanding other party's needs
- **Compromise Development:** Mutual solution creation
