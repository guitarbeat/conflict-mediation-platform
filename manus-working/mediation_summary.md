## Conflict Mediation Website Requirements Summary

### From 'Copyof1.ExampleIntpersonalConflictMediationWorksheet.txt'

This document outlines a structured mediation process for two parties (Katara and Toph) involved in a conflict. It emphasizes both intrapersonal (individual reflection) and interpersonal (discussion between parties) aspects.

**Key Sections and their Purpose:**

1.  **Initial Conflict Description:** Agreed-upon summary of the conflict.
2.  **Intrapersonal Reflection (for each party):**
    *   **I think…:** What each party believes to be true about the conflict.
    *   **I feel…:** Single-word emotions experienced due to the conflict.
    *   **I want…:** Desired outcomes, categorized into Aggressive, Passive, and Assertive communication behaviors. The goal is to promote empathetic communication.
    *   **Why/Because…:** Brief description of why they are experiencing the conflict this way, integrating thoughts, feelings, and wants.
3.  **Interpersonal (ABCDE Model):**
    *   **A - Activating event/adversity:** Agreed-upon initial cause of conflict.
    *   **B - Beliefs:** Discussion and agreement on what each party believes to be true about the event. The listening party writes down what the other said.
    *   **C - Consequence:** Expressing how the events made them feel, with the listening party writing down the emotions.
    *   **D - Disputations:** Opportunity to discuss motivations, misunderstandings, and explain oneself.
    *   **E - Effects:** Reflection on the conversation, sharing experiences to promote understanding and find solutions.
4.  **Miracle Question:** Imagining life after the conflict is resolved to identify desired feelings and goals.
5.  **Solutions/Outcomes:** Identifying top solutions, ideal outcomes, and compromised solutions based on individual and other party's perspectives.
6.  **Negotiation:** Discussing unmet needs, what these needs look like in practice, whether they can be met by the other party, and agreed-upon action steps. It also addresses when outside mediation might be necessary.

**User Roles/Inputs:**
*   Two conflicting parties.
*   Input fields for thoughts, feelings, wants, and explanations.
*   Sections for agreed-upon descriptions and reflections after discussions.

This document describes different types of conflict mediation procedures and the responsibilities of mediators within the ICC Austin co-op.

**Types of Mediation:**

1.  **1:1 Conversations (informal):** Encourages direct communication between community members. Training in 


healthy communication skills is highlighted.
2.  **Communication Coaching (informal):** Mediators help individuals formulate thoughts and prepare for in-person conversations. Focus is on solutions and boosting confidence.
3.  **Interpersonal Mediation (formal):** For persistent conflicts after 1:1 conversations. Involves two mediators and uses a restorative circle process to negotiate mutual agreements.
4.  **House-wide Mediation (formal):** Addresses broader community conflicts, seeking mutual agreement within the house. Certain outcomes (e.g., membership revocation) are restricted.
5.  **Member Conduct Review (formal):** For situations where house-wide mediation is insufficient. Conducted by a committee of trained mediators.

**Mediator Responsibilities (General):**
*   Proper preparation for sessions.
*   Documentation submission to ICC Austin staff.
*   Follow-up with members.
*   Taking next steps for further conflict resolution if needed.

**Website Implications:**
*   The website should primarily focus on facilitating the 


Interpersonal Mediation (formal) process, as detailed in the worksheet, as it provides a structured flow for an interactive application.
*   It could potentially offer resources or guidance for 1:1 conversations and communication coaching.
*   The website should guide users through the ABCDE model, intrapersonal reflections, miracle question, and solution negotiation.
*   It needs to capture inputs from both parties at various stages.
*   The website should be designed to be intuitive for co-op members, not necessarily mediators, although it facilitates a mediation-like process.

**Overall Website Goal:** To provide a guided, interactive platform for co-op members to work through interpersonal conflicts, promoting understanding and collaborative problem-solving based on the provided mediation framework.
