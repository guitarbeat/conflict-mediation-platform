ICC Austin Conflict Mediation

Procedures by Type of Mediation 

    1) 1:1 Conversations (informal)
Communicating your feelings and needs to your fellow community members is a crucial aspect of cooperative living. It is your responsibility to use healthy communication skills to have an in-person conversation to address a conflict when it arises. You can gain these skills by attending ICC Austin’s Healthy Communication 101 Workshop, which is offered multiple times each semester. If you are unable to attend a workshop prior to your conflict and need help planning your approach, you can set up an appointment with a Mediator for communication coaching (see below).

    2) Communication Coaching (informal)

If you need help formulating your thoughts and preparing to have an in-person conversation about a conflict, contact a Mediator at Mediators@iccaustin.coop to schedule a communication coaching session. The Mediator will help you develop an approach to your conversation and help you plan what you might say. Communication coaching is not a venting/gossip session. It is a solutions-oriented meeting to help boost your confidence and communication skills.

Mediator responsibilities:
    • Properly prepare for coaching session 
    • Submit documentation of the session to ICC Austin staff
                • Follow up with member at agreed upon time
                • If necessary, take next steps to set up other modes of conflict resolution



    3) Interpersonal Mediation (formal)
 
After your in-person conversation, allow time for their behavior to change. If the conflict persists, a formal mediation is necessary. Inform the other person(s) involved in the conflict to let them know you are going to request two Mediators. Email the Mediators at Mediators@iccaustin.coop to schedule a mediation. Include the following information in the email:

    • The names and contact information of those involved
    • A brief summary of the conflict
    • What you have already done to try to resolve this conflict


A Mediator will contact everyone involved to schedule a meeting that uses the restorative circle conflict resolution process and helps negotiate the issue. In this process, the members in conflict must try to negotiate a mutual agreement. If no compromise is reached - depending on the issue - this may be grounds for a House-Wide Mediation or a Conduct Committee Review.

Mediator responsibilities:
    • Consult staff prior to mediation (if necessary)
    • Properly prepare for mediation
    • Submit documentation of the mediation to ICC Austin staff
        ◦ Must include time, date, names of members involved, brief description of conflict, outcome of the mediation, and follow-up time
                • Follow up with members 2-3 weeks after the mediation to ensure agreements are being respected
                • If necessary, take next steps to set up other modes of conflict resolution



    4) House-wide Mediation (formal)


A house-wide mediation can be used to address a variety of conflicts. The house community will engage in a conversation about the problem and must seek to find a mutual agreement.

A house-wide mediation cannot result in:
    • Membership revocation
    • Fees charged by the house community
    • Any penalty that 
        ◦ involves unreasonable time requirements
        ◦ impedes a member’s ability to thrive as a student
    • Unjust penalties of any kind
  
Mediators and/or the house community should contact staff with any questions about acceptable potential outcomes for a house-wide mediation.


Mediators’ responsibilities:
    • Consult staff prior to mediation 
    • Properly prepare for mediation
    • Submit minutes of the mediation to ICC Austin staff
        ◦ Must include time, date, community members present, summary of discussions, and outcome of the mediation (including any probationary terms and timelines)
                • Follow up with members after the mediation to ensure agreements are being respected
                • If necessary, take next steps to set up a Member Conduct Review



    5) Member Conduct Review (formal)

 
On occasions when a house-wide mediation is insufficient to resolve a conflict or if a community is unable or unwilling to participate in a house-wide mediation, the Member Conduct Review Committee (MCRC) will serve as an alternate forum to ensure that problems are managed constructively rather than ignored. 

The Member Conduct Review Committee is an operational committee consisting of trained ICC Austin Conflict Mediators who conduct membership reviews. The composition of each MCRC will be five Mediators, each without conflict of interest, from at least three different houses and excluding any member belonging to the house community of the member-under-review. MCRC members rotate and are paid for their time at the same rate as conflict Mediators.
 

A Member Review Committee orientation will be included in Conflict Mediator training each semester with periodic reviews to ensure that the member review process functions smoothly at all times. Staff will provide administrative and other reasonable budgetary support, e.g. legal and consulting, as requested by the MCRC such that they can carry out the membership review process in a fair and independent manner.
