Agreed Upon Description of Conflict
We both agree that the beginning of our conflict was a result of Katara feeling frustrated with Toph’s lack of chores. As well as Toph feeling controlled by Katara’s approach. 


Intrapersonal - Katara

Intrapersonal - The process by which an individual communicates within themselves, acting as both sender and receiver of messages, and encompasses the use of unspoken words to consciously engage in self-talk and inner speech.

In this section, reflect on what you’re experiencing due to the conflict.
I think…
-Explain what you think or believe to be true about the conflict.
I think Toph is acting inconsiderately when it comes to helping others in the house. I believe she thinks only of herself. 
I feel…
Write down some emotions that arise due to the conflict (only use single word descriptions)

*Saying 'I feel like Bruce doesn’t like me and he’s acting in a passive-aggressive way’ is not an emotion; it is a belief/judgment. Emotions are an internal experience, not an evaluation of someone else’s behavior. 

You may research more words to describe how you are feeling.

Frustrated, annoyed, offended, stressed, shocked
I want…
Discuss your desired outcome in the communication phases (see below for examples of aggressive, passive & assertive communication behaviors).
Goal: Bring awareness to the potential of ineffective communication; promote empathetic communication
    1. Aggressive - I want Toph to know that she is extremely rude and inconsiderate. She’s a spoiled brat that has never cleaned up after themselves and expects others to do so.
    2. Passive - I want Toph to reach out to me first. I haven’t reached out to her because I don’t want to make her feel bad. But if she doesn’t reach out, I will continue to clean up after her, to keep the peace.
    3. Assertive - I want Toph and I to discuss how her behaviors are impacting me. I understand that she may not be used to the type of environment that myself and the others are in. I want us to express ourselves so that we both feel heard. I am also open to hearing what she feels about me and my behaviors. 
Why/Because…
Usin all 3 previous boxes, write down a brief description of why you are experiencing the conflict this way.
I think Toph is acting in a way that is inconsiderate to others because she hasn’t made an effort to contribute to chores.
I feel frustrated, annoyed, and stressed because I don’t believe my concerns are being respected. 
I want to have an open and honest discussion with Toph regarding her behavior because we all have to share this space, and we should work together to solve issues.

In this section, reflect on what you’re experiencing due to the conflict.
I think…
-Explain what you think or believe to be true about the conflict.
I think Katara is being way too critical of the things I do. I believe she is trying to control all of my actions. I think she believes it should always be her way.

Offended, betrayed, irritated 
I want…
Discuss your desired outcome in the communication phases (see below for examples of aggressive, passive & assertive communication behaviors).
Goal: Bring awareness to the potential of ineffective communication; promote empathetic communication
    1. Aggressive - I want Katara to stop being so controlling. I want her to mind her own business and leave me alone.
    2. Passive - I want Katara to be lenient on me because I’m new. I won’t say anything because it’s not my place to change what’s been going on here. I want to make Katara happy, so I’ll just do what she says 
    3. Assertive - I want Katara and I to not yell at each other and instead find a solution to this issue. I want us to discuss boundaries. 	
Why/Because…
Using all 3 previous boxes, write down a brief description of why you are experiencing the conflict this way.
I think Katara is acting way too controlling because she tells me what to do instead of asking me what I can do and how I’d like to contribute.

I feel irritated and betrayed because when we first met, Katara seemed open and helpful, but now she’s trying to make decisions for me. 

I want Katara and me to figure out where we’re coming from because I don’t want either of us to feel disrespected. We should try to understand and respect each other’s boundaries. 


Interpersonal

A - Activating event/adversity:
All parties should discuss and eventually agree on the initial cause or conflict.
We both agree that the beginning of our conflict was a result of Katara feeling frustrated with Toph’s lack of chores. As well as Toph feeling controlled by Katara’s approach. 
B - Beliefs: After an agreed-upon activating incident, all parties should discuss what they believe to be true about the event (refer back to your personal beliefs in the ‘I Think…” section. After discussion, the listening party is to use the space to write down what the other had said. Talk with each other until all parties agree on the written down beliefs of the other(s).
Katara - I think Toph is acting in a way that is inconsiderate to others because she hasn’t made an effort to contribute to chores

Toph - I think Katara is acting way too controlling because she tells me what to do instead of asking me what I can do and how I’d like to contribute.
C - Consequence: Use the ‘I feel…because’ section to express  how the events made/make you feel with the other party. The listening party will write down the other’s emotions. All parties should be aware of all the emotions involved before moving on.
Katara - I feel frustrated, annoyed and stressed because I don’t believe my concerns are being respected. 

Toph - I feel irritated and betrayed because when we first met, Katara seemed open and helpful but now she’s trying to make decisions for me. 
D - Disputations: This section should be used as an interview session. This is the opportunity to discuss with the conflicting party some of the motivations and misunderstandings that have occurred. This is also an opportunity to explain oneself regarding the conflict. 
Toph is reluctant to do chores because she was not aware that others cared more than she did about them. She believes in working solely in an individual sense, meaning that you do things because you want to. She also explained her experience growing up was one where she did not have to actively think about doing chores. Her response with aloofness or apathy was a result of her feeling like she was being spoken at rather than spoken to. 

Katara has these concerns for chores because she believes it helps keep our space organized. She attributes her frustrations to the belief that not contributing to chores creates an atmosphere of inequity. Katara now understands how her behavior can make her seem like a control freak.
E - Effects: Take this time to reflect on the conversation regarding conflict personally. Please share your experiences with the other party to promote understanding and lay the groundwork for finding a solution or compromise.
I’ve learned that I’ve made Toph uncomfortable. I think talking things out so far has made me see things from her perspective.

Katara has made me realize that my actions were less about the chores and more about a deeper connection to trust and respect. 

Intrapersonal - Katara

Miracle Question:
The ‘miracle question’ is an extension of goal setting or a technique for facilitating the identification of goals. It also helps to throw light on existing solutions and resources while fostering a climate of change (O'Connell, 2005; p48).  The ‘miracle question’ invites people to use their imagination to describe in some detail what their lives will be like when the problem no longer dominates or controls it (O’Connell, 2003).
Miracle Question: If you woke up tomorrow, and by magic or miracle, the conflict had been resolved, what do you imagine you’d feel as a result of the change?
I’d feel thankful, excited, confident and content because we are living in an equitable environment. Those feelings from a place of shared responsibility, reliability and accountability that fosters trust in each other. 


After having the conversation using the ABCDE model & the emotions imagined through the miracle question, write down solutions based on the following scenarios -
Write down your top 3 solutions/outcomes 
1. Toph and I discuss what equitable chores are 
2. Toph cleans her share without having to be told


Choose your ideal outcome/solution based on the 3 from above.

Interpersonal 


Negotiation - After working on intrapersonal, interpersonal, and proposed solutions, it is now time to work on negotiating the outcomes. It is essential to keep the resolution goal as the primary focus for this portion. It is recommended that each party is in a mindset of compromise and, at the same time, in agreement with the possibility of an agreement to disagree, pushing this process to the next step of involving an outside party to help mediate. 
What are each other’s unmet needs? (concepts that incorporate equal responsibility from all parties)
Katara - Respect, Communication

Toph - Respect, Patience 
What do these needs look like in practice?   (Offering ideal solution underneath suggested met need in practice)
Katara - Expressing emotions in a cordial way and having an open mind
-Toph and I talk and eventually agree on what we believe to be a mutual set of chores.
Toph - Dialogue rather than assuming. Being more helpful/curious than punitive when it comes to chores.
-Katara and I talk about what works best for the group
Can these needs be met by the other party?
Katara - Yes
Toph - Yes
If yes, what are the actions that need to be taken to meet the needs
Katara - I will ask Toph if there are any issues before demanding results
Toph - I will ask for help and suggest alternatives before shutting Katara down. 
If no, please explain why these proposed needs cannot be met

Do the unmet needs call for further mediation from an outside mediator?

If no, what are the agreed-upon action steps to respectfully disagree and remain cordial?

If yes, please decide on a mediator and time to help resolve the conflict.
